GeoBikeLLM is an intelligent route planning system for cyclists in Chicago, Illinois, that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), environmental datasets (Air Quality, NDVI), and OpenStreetMap (OSM) bike infrastructure. It allows users to input trip requests in natural language, choose their environmental preferences (healthier or greener routes), and receive optimized bike paths with map visualizations and explanations.

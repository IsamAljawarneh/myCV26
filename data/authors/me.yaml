bio: |
  Dr. Isam Mashhour Al Jawarneh is an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science at the University of Sharjah, UAE, 
  where he leads research at the intersection of geospatial data science, big data systems, and smart city analytics. 
  He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering from the University of Bologna, Italy, in 2020, 
  and served as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow there until 2022. His work centers on scalable, real-time processing of spatiotemporal data
  streams—developing novel Cloud- and Edge-based architectures, QoS-aware approximate query techniques, 
  and intelligent data management frameworks for urban and environmental applications. 
  His research has been published in premier IEEE venues such as GLOBECOM and ICC, 
  and his contributions—particularly in spatial stream processing and distributed geospatial analytics—are advancing 
  how cities leverage big data for timely, context-aware decision-making. 
  Dr. Al Jawarneh also serves on Technical Program Committees for leading IEEE conferences and actively bridges theoretical innovation 
  with practical deployment in smart infrastructure systems.
